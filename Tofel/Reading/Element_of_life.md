The creation of life requires a set of chemical elements for making the components of cells. Life on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements, although just 4 of these elements-oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen-make up about 96 percent of the mass of living organisms. Thus, a first requirement for life might be the presence of most or all of the elements used by life.
创造生命需要一系列化学元素来组成细胞。地球上的生命在92种自然产生的化学元素中，拥有大约25种，尽管其中四种：氧，碳，氢，氮占据了96%的生物体质量。因此，首先生命需要大多数，或者全部这些被生命使用的元素。


Interestingly, this requirement can probably be met by almost any world. Scientists have determined that all chemical elements in the universe besides hydrogen and helium (and a trace amount of lithium) were produced by stars. These are known as heavy elements because they are heavier than hydrogen and helium. Although all of these heavy elements are quite rare compared to hydrogen and helium, they are found just about everywhere.
有趣的是，这种需求能被大部分星球所满足。科学家坚信所有除了氢和氦的元素(还有一些**微量** 的锂)是恒星所产出的。他们被称为重元素，因为他们比氢和氦要重。尽管这些重元素和氢和氦比起来确实很少，他们却能在大概任何地方被发现。

Heavy elements are continually being manufactured by stars and released into space by stellar deaths , so their amount compared to hydrogen and helium gradually rises with time. Heavy elements make up about 2 percent of the chemical content (by mass) of our solar system; the other 98 percent is hydrogen and helium. In some very old star systems, which formed before many heavy elements were produced, the heavy-element share may be less than 0.1 percent. Nevertheless , every star system studied has at least some amount of all the elements used by life. Moreover, when planetesimals-small, solid objects formed in the early solar system that may accumulate to become planets-condense within a forming star system, they are inevitably made from heavy elements because the more common hydrogen and helium remain gaseous. Thus, planetesimals everywhere should contain the elements needed for life, which means that objects built from planetesimals-planets, moons, asteroids, and comets-also contain these elements. The nature of solar-system formation explains why Earth contains all the elements needed for life, and it is why we expect these elements to be present on other worlds throughout our solar system, galaxy, and universe.
重元素持续被恒星产生并通过星球死亡释放到宇宙中，所以对比氢和氦，他们的数量在与日俱增。重元素占据我们太阳系2%的质量，其他98%是氢和氦。在一些在许多重元素尚未产生时便已经形成的、非常古老的恒星系统中，重元素可能分配到少于0.1%的质量。然而，每个被发现的恒星系统中都包含一定量的所有创造生命必须的元素。此外，当星子-即在早期太阳系中形成的、可能累计成行星的小型固体-在恒星系统中压缩成型的时候，他们必然由重元素组成，因为更常见的氢和氦还是气状。因此，任何地方的星子都应当包含生命所需的元素，这意味着由星子形成的物体，包括行星，卫星，小行星，彗星，都包含这些元素。太阳系形成过程的性质解释了为什么地球包含生命所需的所有元素，这也是为什么我们期望这些元素在太阳系、银河系以及宇宙的其他地方出现。

Note that this argument does not change, even if we allow for life very different from life on Earth. Life on Earth is carbon based, and most biologists believe that life elsewhere is likely to be carbon based as well. However, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of life with another chemical basis, such as silicon or nitrogen. The set of elements (or their relative proportions) used by life based on some other element might be somewhat different from that used by carbon-based life on Earth. But the elements are still products of stars and would still be present in planetesimals everywhere. No matter what kinds of life we are looking for, we are likely to find the necessary elements on almost every planet, moon, asteroid, and comet in the universe.
