I favor department stores more than those small specialty stores.
One reason is that anything I want can be purchased from large grocery stores, so it is an ideal place for me to buy dresses, tops, shorts, bags and shoes at the same time. 
Another reason is that other entertainment facilities can also be offered by large grocery stores.
 When I get bored and tired, my parents or friends can go to caf√© or restaurant and treat ourselves with a movie afterwards.
