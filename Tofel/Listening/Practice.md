# Listenning Practice

## Writing Materials

1. The reason i think this painting is so important is that it stressed the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style.
2. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls was to observe people and the ways that they moved
3. You would(will) notice that the women's  face is so realistic (+looking) and seems(it is almost) like a photograph. She(The women's nose) is a little less than perfect and her hair is a little(kind of) messed up.It(That) is realism. 
4. I find Frentzen a really accessable artist

Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at the curtain painting.
It is a farm scene. And you will see it right afer you come into the galary
it an outdoor scene, a everyday scene

Today i want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, and other geologic feature is-- date tequniques
